## Next Steps
- [ ] Improve the UI.
- [ ] Add color change to it.
- [ ] Instead of using the localstorage use redux, It is better and improved the ui.
- [ ] As the button in programming languages are click the data dispaly in the pie chart change as well.
- [ ] Add more color to the commits chart, right now it it is too simple
- [ ] Add Projects and be able to sort it by different types.
- [ ] Improve the size of the pie chart. Right now it is really big.

## Things to Considered but they are not that necessary
- [ ] The Pie Chart works right now, but It will be better to improve the code, TBH I think it will be required to modify a lot of it, it used localstorage and the redux should be the one taking care of that
