TODO:- For new users, it uses 21 api calls. but all the users
    are store in the same place.

    - Number of commits per project just show data max of 30,
    it required to fix this problem. also if there are more
    than 10 projects then display this pannel bellow

    - Under the picture of the user display the following data
      * project with the most commits.
      * how many commits from other users his project receives
      * it could change the design of the box that display the
        languages, also included some kind of label to know
        which is the user more expert, and be able to sort them.

    - Thrid pannel requires to improve desing


Once I submit the username of a github account, How to make it work
such as it will display a rendering loading once all the elements
are loaded, My main concern is that it looks all the code will be
used react and none will be html, It make sense, becuase that is
part of the functionality of the server side, render the html.
It looks it will have to use either create a class for that or
write the whole page in react and render it that way. 

Things to do :
[X] The cards elements should be better looking.
[X] Make the site totally mobile friendly
[X] Show the number of projects when the mouse is over the language
[X] Improve the panel of the information about the users and others
[X] Improve the color of the home page, either add some kind of 
    picture in the background and some css for the loading part
    (Like walmart does)

Wish list: 
[ ] Add some projects links, and their date of last commit or something like that
    add that information like a second pannel for the projects, add a tab to that
    pannell, Add some kind of filter, either use the date of the last commit
    # of projects.
