TODO:- For new users, it uses 21 api calls. but all the users
    are store in the same place.
    - It requires to enter one name and then after store
      all the data, the page must reload to see all the
      data. It is required to solve this problem 

Once I submit the username of a github account, How to make it work
such as it will display a rendering loading once all the elements
are loaded, My main concern is that it looks all the code will be
used react and none will be html, It make sense, becuase that is
part of the functionality of the server side, render the html.
It looks it will have to use either create a class for that or
write the whole page in react and render it that way. \
